Hi ! I am a student in cognitive science at ENS-PSL (centered on computational neuroscience). Currently I am a research intern at NeuroPSI-Paris Saclay (Cognitive & Network Neuroscience unit) working on the neural circuits of decision-making in <i>Drosophila</i>. I look at the neural bases of the decision-making process at circuit and single neuron Level. Practically, what I do is computational analysis of neural circuits that underlie competitive interactions between actions in <i>Drosophila larva</i>. 

My research interests are in the neural dynamics underlying cognitive processes, with particular emphasis on decision-making and behaviour. I am particularly interested in how circuit-level mechanisms give rise to emergent population-level phenomena, I find neural manifolds and neural population geometry quite appealing. You can find more about my interests and background in my [CV](https://gasparrrrrrrd.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Outside of work, I like French New Wave Cinema, as well Woody Allen's movies (especially the good old funny ones). Outside of cinema I try to cherish moments in my life and table tennis!

Short Bio
======
Somehow you landed on my personal page, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gaspard, born in Munich to french and danish parents. I grew up between Germany and Brussels and went on to study in the Netherlands. I first studied [Nanobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanobiotechnology) at TU Delft, did mostly maths and physics applied to biology at the very small scale that is the nanometer (avg. diameter of globular proteins is ~5 nm, same for a virus, while diameter of DNA is 2.04 nm, the size of a glucose molecule is 1.5 nm). There I did a research internship in applied biophysics, in [Marileen Dogterom's lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/tnw/over-faculteit/afdelingen/bionanoscience/research/research-labs/marileen-dogterom-lab), in the BioNanoscience Department of the TU Delft. I investigated the biophysics of microtubules, in the context of a synthetic cell. We looked at the spatial organisation of these essential filaments in constrained environments. In particular, we tried to control aster (the microtubule organising center in the cell) positioning in droplets. 

During my BSc. I took a minor in Brain & Cognition which lead me to reconsider life at the bigger scale. From there on I did another research intenship in cognitive neuroscience. This lead me to go study cognitive science at ENS-PSL, in Paris. I am mostly focused on computational neuroscience and neuroAI. This means I mostly study mathematical methods and theories that apply to neural networks, as well as to cognitive subjects.
